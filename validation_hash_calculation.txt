Validation Hash Calculation


To ensure data integrity, a validation hash must be generated using the following fields in a specific sequence:


1. Basket ID
2. Merchant Secured Key
3. Merchant ID
4. Error Code (received from PayFast)

The string sequence should be in the following format:


"your_basket_id|your_merchant_secret_key|your_merchant_id|payfast_err_code"


Example:


BAS-01|jdnkaabcks|102|000


Calculate the SHA256 hash of the concatenated string:


e8192a7554dd699975adf39619c703a492392edf5e416a61e183866ecdf6a2a2


Note: The pipe "|" character is included in the string.


To verify data integrity, compare the calculated hash with the value received from PayFast. Both values should match
